# Week 1

## Implications

There is a multitude of meanings when it comes to the use of the word "implication". There is a good detailed explanation in the script.
To provide an overview consider the following:


### Implications between Mathematical statements


<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš§">
  we will add some more stuff from the first week here
</Callout>

The arrow "$\implies$" can be used between mathematical statements to form a new mathematical statement. For example, let $S$ and $T$ be mathematical statements. Then we can form the mathematical statement $S \implies T$. The new statement can be translated into natural language by saying that "that ***if** $S$ is true, **then** $T$ is also true*" (which is a statement that can be false). It does **not** mean that **because** $S$ is true, $T$ is also true.

For example, consider the following statements:
- $S$: "$2$ is an even number"
- $T$: "$5 + 10 = 15$"

In this case, $S \implies T$ is true. This may seem counterintuitive, but it is a true mathematical statement. The statement $S \implies T$ does not mean that there is a derivation from $S$ to $T$.

Additionally, it can be quite counterintuitive to consider the statement $S \implies T$ when you know that the statement $S$ is actually false. This automatically makes $S \implies T$ **true** because we essentially *don't care* about the truth value of the statement $T$. Since $S$ is false, the implication *"if $S$ is true, then $T$ is also true"* is vacuously true because $S$ is not true â€” we don't need to check whether $T$ is true.

For example, consider the following statements:
- $S$: "$2$ is an odd number"
- $T$: "$3$ is an even number"

If we now consider $S \implies T$, we would find that $S \implies T$ is indeed a **true** statement because we know $S$ is false.

Note that the only case where the statement $S \implies T$ is false is when $S$ is a true statement and $T$ is a false statement.

## EBNF: Statements vs Formulas

This tries to define formulas and statements with EBNF. Bold symbols are used to denote EBNF syntax elements **(** **)** **\[** **]** **â”‚**. References to existing rules are made using `Rulenameâ€¦` element.

## Exercises

<Problem title="Problem 1" source="Tobias Steinbrecher">
  <div label="question">
  Define logical binary operator $\circ$ as follows:

    |$A$ | $B$ | $A \circ B$|
    |---|---|---|
    |$0$ |$0$ | $1$ |
    |$0$ |$1$ | $1$ |
    |$1$ |$0$ | $1$ |
    |$1$ |$1$ | $0$ |

    For each of the following formulas, write an **equivalent** formula using only the $\circ$ operator. Prove the equivalence in each case.
  1. $\lnot A$ <br/>
  2. $A \land B$ <br/>
  3. $A \lor B$ <br/>
  </div>
  <div label="answer">
   First, consider:

  |$A$|$\lnot A$|
  |---|---|
  | 0| 1|
  | 1| 0|

      We have to somehow use $\circ$ such that the formula *evaluates* to false exactly when $A$ is $1$.
    One could for example find the formula $A \circ A$ and prove the result by writing the function table:

    | $A$ |$A \circ A $|
      |---|---|
      | 0| 1|
      | 1| 0|

  which is indeed equivalent. Usually one has to make observations in these types of problems and use them cleverly to create the formula. Thus
  $$
  \lnot A \equiv A \circ A
  $$
  </div>
<div label="answer">
Consider $(A \circ B) \circ (A \circ B)$

 |$A$ | $B$ | $(A \circ B) \circ (A \circ B)$ | $A \land B$ |
    |---|---|---| ---|
    |$0$ |$0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
    |$0$ |$1$ | $0$ |$0$ |
    |$1$ |$0$ | $0$ |$0$ |
    |$1$ |$1$ | $1$ |$1$ |

The idea here is to use the $\lnot$ operator from the previous exercise to invert the outcome of $A \circ B$, which is exactly $A \land B$ (more precisely, $\circ$ is a [NAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffer_stroke) function).

</div>

<div label="answer">

Consider $(A \circ A) \circ (B \circ B)$

 |$A$ | $B$ | $(A \circ A) \circ (B \circ B)$ | $A \lor B$ |
    |---|---|---| ---|
    |$0$ |$0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
    |$0$ |$1$ | $1$ |$1$ |
    |$1$ |$0$ | $1$ |$1$ |
    |$1$ |$1$ | $1$ |$1$ |

Note that $A \circ B \equiv \lnot (A \land B)$ (NAND operation).
The idea here is to use the $\lnot$ operator we built in the previous exercise to invert $A$ and $B$ individually. Then we basically use De Morgan's equivalence: $\lnot(\lnot A \land \lnot B) \equiv A \lor B$ to obtain the final result (i.e. one more $\circ$ operation between $\lnot A$ and $\lnot B$).

</div>
  <div label="hint">Note that $A \circ B \equiv \lnot (A \land B)$</div>
  <div label= "takeaway">   Usually one has to make some kind of observations in these types of problems and use them cleverly to create the formula. Sometimes known equivalences such as in the 3. subtask can help.
   To prove the **equivalence** one can then simply use *comparison of function tables* (this step is trivial in comparison to finding a correct function). Note that there might be more than one possible solution.</div>

<Problem title="Equivalence Transformations" source="Philipp Barski">
  <div label="question">
      Consider the formula $F = (B \lor A) \lor \neg C$. Find a formula $G$ such that $G$ only contains the logical operation $\to$ and propositional symbols $A,B,C$ (Note that parentheses are allowed as well).<br/>
       Solve this problem either by using equivalence transformations from Lemma 2.1 and the rules
       $$
       F \land \neg F \equiv \bot, \  F \land \bot \equiv \bot, \ F \lor \bot \equiv F,\  F \lor \neg F \equiv \top, \ F \land \top \equiv F, \ F \lor \top \equiv \top
       $$
       or drawing the truth table and trying to find a formula fulfilling the upper constraints.
  </div>
  <div label="answer">
    We provide an answer using equivalence transformations. The idea is to see that the formula has a form that could give a hint that $C$ will be on the left side of the arrow according to the definition. We just need to find a trick such that the formula gets a better form for us to use, maybe we can find a form similar to the definition of the arrow "$\to$", or the negation of "$\to$"? We provide a formal solution in the following.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      && (B \lor A) \lor \neg C &&\\
      \equiv && ((B \lor A) \land \top) \lor \neg C &&\text{($F \land \top \equiv F$)}\\
      \equiv && ((B \lor A) \land (B \lor \neg B)) \lor \neg C &&\text{($F \lor \neg F \equiv \top$)}\\
      \equiv && (B \lor (A \land \neg B)) \lor \neg C &&\text{(distr. law)}\\
      \equiv && ((A \land \neg B) \lor B) \lor \neg C &&\text{(commutativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (B \lor \neg C) &&\text{(associativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (\neg C \lor B) &&\text{(commutativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(def. "$\to$")}\\
      \equiv && (\neg \neg A \land \neg B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(double negation)}\\
      \equiv && \neg (\neg A \lor B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(De Morgan's law)}\\
      \equiv && \neg (A \to B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(Def. "$\to$")}\\
      \equiv && (A \to B) \to (C \to B) &&\text{(Def. "$\to$")}\\
    \end{aligned}
    $$
  </div>

  <div label="hint">
    The trick when using equivalence transformations here is to make this step:
    $$
    (B \lor A) \lor \neg C \equiv ((B \lor A) \land \top) \lor \neg C
    $$
     How can we conveniently replace $\top$ such that the formula looks like something we can transform further?
  </div>
  <div label= "takeaway">
  For such problems, you often need to find a clever trick to get the formula to some other nice form. Often, the first thing you want to do is try out some common tricks and see whether you can get the formula into any other form. It is also possible to write down the truth table and try to fit a formula to the truth values.
